## Why a Binary Counter?

First time using an arduino and I made an LED blink, which was AWESOME. So I decided to do it x8.

Also sorta kinda wanna attach this to a raspberry pi and use it as a binary counter that counts
down the days until interview season. This was my intention if I had another [Arduino] UNO to just
dedicate to being a countdown clock. Unfortunately that's not the case, so I'm going to have to 
tape that one up to my wall later.

Thanks for checking this sketch out! Much love.
