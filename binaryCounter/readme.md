## Why a Binary Counter?

<img src="binaryCounter.gif"/>

First time doing arduino stuff, so I wanted to expand on the standard LED-blink "Hello World!"
project.

Also sorta kinda wanna attach this to a raspberry pi and use it as a binary counter that counts
down the days until interview season (as of now 10010001 days away). This was my intention if I 
had another [Arduino] UNO to just dedicate to being a countdown clock. Unfortunately that's not
the case, so I'm going to have to tape that one up to my wall later. For now, I'll tear down
and just keep on with the arduino funsies.

Anyway, thanks for checking this sketch out! I appreciate it.
