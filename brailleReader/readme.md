## Why a braille reader?

<img src="brailleReader.gif"/>

Hi peeps! This is my submission for SD Hacks 2018, held between October 12 (2018) - October 14 (2018).

The setup for this one is a little different. I am putting up credit/sources first, then I will clean up the readme when submissions are due (or 9AM PST tomorrow (Sunday, Oct. 14).

Just keep in mind that this is simply a proof of concept, and not a complete, workable, production device. The point is to show this is
a completely possible idea without spending a thousand dollars on a reading device.
