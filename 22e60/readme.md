# 22e60 -- Password Generator

## Why?

Because obfuscating password generation with a custom-base alphabet is something that struck me on Thursday night in August 2019. Go figure.

## How?

My LCD display can only fit 32 character, which will be generated by several stimuli in the immediate environment thanks to the many sensors I currently own.

It would take something like:
Ultrasonic Sensor 1: 300
Temperature: 23 degrees C
Humidity: 38%
R LED: 1
G LED: 0
B LED: 0
Y LED: 1
Sum: 105

Your Password: 9sp2;]}w\2|54?.,Aw1#wT32W-_=qW2]

## Thoughts:
<ol>
  <li>
    I could totally make custom glyphs for the liquid crystal display to obfuscate information more. But to what end? haha.
  </li>
  <li>
    I need to find out a way to create information from these inputs in the form of 4 digit groups.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alphabet:" 1!2@3#4$5%6^7&8*9(0)-_=+]}\|[{pPoOiIuUyYtTrReEwWqQaAsSdDfFgGhHjJkKlL;:'"/?.>,<mMnNbBvVcCxXzZ"
    >
    >> 93 Choose 32, 93 possible characters, or an alphabet of base 93, that chooses 32 characters to generate a password.
  </li>
</ol>

## Statistics

Total unique passwords possible:
P(n,r)=P(93,32)
= 93! / (93âˆ’32)!
= 2.278994482E+60
### = 2,278,994,482,951,704,616,554,139,354,736,922,451,928,637,507,549,265,920,000,000
### = 2.2 octodecillion passwords possible
