# 22e60 -- Password Generator

# Why?

Because obfuscating password generation with a custom-base alphabet is something that struck me on Thursday night in August 2019. Go figure.

# How?

My LCD display can only fit 32 character, which will be generated by several stimuli in the immediate environment thanks to the many sensors I currently own.

It would take something like:
Humidity Sensor 1: 38%
Humidity Sensor 2: 23%
R LED: 1
G LED: 0
B LED: 0
Y LED: 1
Ultrasonic Sensor 1: 300
Ultrasonic Sensor 2: 288
Counter: 0382
Sound Sensor: 688
Angular Rotation Sensor: 32
Light Sensor: 491
Moisture Sensor: 885
