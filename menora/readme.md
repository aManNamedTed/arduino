So it's November 5th 2018, and I just learned that RGB LEDs distinct color fluctuations do not really register with the LED. So my idea was to use a(n) [Arduino] Mega and have the colors of the candles be RGB and cute but NO, using two colors for digitalWrite() and one for analogWrite() for those juicy RGB colors doesn't look all that great. So instead I am just going to use the Mega for its PWM slots and make a nice flicker function and have them offset on each candle so that it actually looks like--

Oh my gah. I could totally use a sensor to detect wind or something, or some kind of motion to make the flickered candles flicker in a manner that looks like real candles. Oh my god. That would be so sick.

I think for now I'm going to make them flicker, offset, then try to do the sensor + flicker with stimulus later.

For now, flicker function writing time!
