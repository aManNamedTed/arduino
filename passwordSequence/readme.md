# Why a password sequence [using buttons]?

<img src="passwordSequence.gif">
Well because I can, and it's awesome! <br/><br/>

All I wanted to do tonight was play around with the lcd screen and practice reading
resistors and yet, it's 2:38AM and I'm writing this so... that's a thing.

After I got the screen running, I started playing around with buttons and then this
happened. Maybe when I get some MOSFETs and prettier buttons I'll spend less time
having fun with 12V stuffs.

## PSYCH!

Yeah so I bought like $40 more worth of components and I can tell this is going to
be one <i>expensive</i> hobby.
